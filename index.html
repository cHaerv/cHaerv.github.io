        <h2>Utulur</h2>
        <h3>class: Star</h3>
        <h3>mass: 0.08 Solar masses</h3>
        <p>Utulur is the small but fairly bright star, its mass is almost planatery and it is stull unknown as to how it
          maintains fusion.</p>
        <p>The surrounding asteroids around this star may contain unseen devices to aid the stars ability to continue to
          burn brightly.</p>

        <h2>Ignotum Prime</h2>
        <h3>class: Planet</h3>
        <h3>mass: 0.055 Earths</h3>
        <p>This planets surface seems to be littered with mountanous regions and copper oxide deposits giving the
          signature green tint</p>
        <p>It is yet unknown why this copper was not harvested by whatever inhabited the system but super conductors
          found amoungst wreckage might explain as to why none of it was harvested</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Orbis Terrarum</h2>
        <h3>class: Planet and Habitat</h3>
        <h3>mass: 1.53 Earths</h3>
        <p>This gas Giant has not been explored due to the volatile nature of its habitat. It is believed that this was
          some form of offworld colony due to the drift of Ignotum prime closer to its Star</p>
        <p>The habitat appears to be self contained and orbits around the planet to harvest its resources but is as of
          now innoperable.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Bellum Scissum</h2>
        <h3>class: Planet</h3>
        <h3>mass: 0.078 Earths</h3>
        <p>This planet may resemble mars but was thought to have been terraformed once before due to its natural
          deposits of carbon layers indicating an agricultural society.</p>
        <p>Many fragments of Thorium-231 have been found along with Lead-207 possibly indicating a large scale use of
          fission or maybe even radioactive shelling on the planets surface.</p>
